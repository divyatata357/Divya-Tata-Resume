<u>Projects</u></h2>
<p> Online Payroll System : This web application can maintain and view
computerized records without getting redundant
entries. The project describes how to manage user
data for good performance and provide better services
for the client.
It is used to manage their employee's expenses,
allowances, salary,
gross salary deduction, tax, and many more for a
specific time period.
Technology used : Python and Django </p>
<p> Satellite Data Processing Environment Using ML : Used various image processing techniques such as
image enhancement, image segmentation, feature
extraction, etc. to analyze the satellite images.
I have carried out the image enhancement technique
by using DWT algorithm to remove noise, sharpen, and
highlight certain interesting features of the satellite
images.</p>
<p>Power Consumption and Activity Monitor
(Android): Developed an application that is able to identify the
tasks and activities consuming battery resources using
Android Studio and Java. The app can log the historical
monitoring data and make it available for the end-user
to review it.
Through this app we can monitor CPU usage, GPU,
RAM and System information, Internal and External
storages. And it also gives us more
information about battery , Screen, Camera, Sound
card, networking and external ports.</p>
